## 🔌 **Socket Event Contract (Teen Patti)**

### **Client → Server Events:**
- `get-table { user_id, token, boot_value, no_of_players }`
- `join-table { user_id, token, table_id }`
- `start-game { table_id }`
- `bet { action, amount }` (call, raise, pack)
- `show { target_player_id }`
- `leave-table {}`

### **Server → Client Events:**
- `get-table { code, message, table_id, boot_value, no_of_players }`
- `join-table { code, message, table_id, seat_no }`
- `game-start { game_id, players, dealer }`
- `deal { hands }`
- `betting-round { phase, current_player, min_bet, pot }`
- `bet-update { player_id, action, amount, pot }`
- `showdown { winner_id, hands, pot, winnings }`
- `game-end { results }`

---

## 🎮 **Game Flow**

### **1. Table Selection**
- User selects boot amount (₹50, ₹100, ₹200, ₹500, ₹1000, ₹2000)
- System finds available table with matching boot value
- If no table exists, creates new one
- Automatically fills empty seats with bots

### **2. Game Start**
- All players join table
- System deals 3 cards to each player
- First betting round begins (Blind)

### **3. Betting Rounds**
- **Blind**: Players bet without seeing cards
- **Seen**: Players look at cards and bet accordingly
- **Show**: Players can challenge others to show cards

### **4. Game End**
- Showdown determines winner
- Winner takes pot (all boot amounts + bets)
- New round begins or table closes
